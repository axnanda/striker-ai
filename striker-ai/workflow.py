# Description:
#   This file is the main workflow file for the stats-gen project.
#   It is responsible for orchestrating the agents and tools to
#   extract, analyze, and adapt player statistics from various sources.
#   Later will be made into seperate files for each agent, tool, and task
# 
#  tools we know we can use (all langchain plugins):
#   Chat gpt plguins (Agones, diagram maker, graph gen)
#   DuckDuckGoSearchRun (search tool)
#   Custom tool: MonsterAPI (js port) 
#      - Later expanding monster using goldeneye
#   Google Search API
#   serper.dev
#   Nuclia Understanding
#   requests
